Research for the presentation on Friday March 12, 2014
on GIS and GeoTIFF implementation.

What is GIS?
- GIS (Geographical Information System): system that manages and analyzes 
	geographical data. Used to provide spatial data visualization.
- Raster GIS: Uses cartography and imagery data to give a representation 
	of the studied area. Reveals relationships
		- Ex. vegetation, land use, urban change

How GIS helps farmers
- Shows growth or crop
- Reveals problem areas and also trends in growth with data like moisture

What is GeoTIFF?
- Based on the TIFF raster data format
- Stores georeferencing data with the image in one file
	- Normally an image has to be georeferenced manually (control points)
- Because it is a georeferenced image, can be imported into most GSI
	software and layered onto a georeferenced basemap

Creating GeoTIFF
- GDAL (Geospatial Data Abstraction Library)
	- Open source translator library for raster geospatial data formats
- Provides the code and tools to create georeferenced images

Example of GeoTIFF
- First show how to create one using gdal_translate + gdaltransform
- Import into ArcMaps

Is this what we need?
- Based on the survey results
	- Do farmers use GIS directly or have some one do the analysis?
	- Can we just provide GeoTIFFs from the drone images?

Next Steps
- Pull an image from the drone and georeferencing
	- Either with the GPS or with mock values
- Look into creating a basemap for our April Tag System
	- Lets us test GeoTIFF indoors
	- Important because of the low-resolution on the bottom camera
- Work with image-stitching + GPS to add the 3+ control points needed
	- Using either the source code or the tools given
